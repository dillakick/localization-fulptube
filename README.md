Localization for FulpTube

Use `template.php` and use the ISO language codes as the filename. For example, Canadian English would be en_CA.

## How do I add my language?

Make a pull request with the title being the language. For example, if you wanted to translate French for FulpTube, name the file `fr.php`, and copy the contents from `template.php` to `fr.php` and translate the text inside your new `fr.php` file then commit it to your fork.
